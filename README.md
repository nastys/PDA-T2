# PDA-T2
What is PDA-T2?

PDA-T2 is the continuation of the PDA-T project that I started a few months back to make the game Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Arcade playable in English to some extent. With the public dump of Arcade Future Tone, I thought a new revision of this project was in order.

What does it do?

PDA-T2 aims to provide an okay player experience to someone with no knowledge of the Japanese language. Basically, make the core game and it's menus understandable and usable to a non-Japanese speaker.

How do I install it?

Just drag the files from the latest commit (hosted on GitHub) into your 2d folder (for the .farc files) and to the rom folder of your dump. (for the pv_db.txt file) Then, run the game and enjoy!

Something is wrong, what can I do?

If there's an issue with the graphics or text (apart from the font) used in PDA-T2, please let me know either by making an issue on GitHub or messaging me on Discord at Jay39#7310.

Can I upload footage of the game using this translation to YouTube?

Yes, but with credit either in the Description or Video itself. Same applies for other social networking sites or video hosting.
